# Data Science Projects Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and analyses that I have conducted in the field of data analytics and data science. Each project is self-contained with its own datasets, notebooks, and documentation.

## Projects
Below is a list of projects included in this repository:

- **Project 1**: BlackRock Inc's Tech Index vs. S&P 500 Benchmark Analysis
  - **Description**: Which is a better index for your money? The S&P 500 or BlackRock Inc's Technology Index Fund? In this project, we'll find out. The goal of this project is to inform investors of the best performing investment vehicle by using real, historical data.
  - **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.
  - **Key Findings**: Blackrock's Technology ETF has a higher annual growth rate than the S&P 500, however, it took much longer for the technology sector to recover from the "dot com" collapse while the S&P recovered much faster. Therefore, the S&P 500 index is a better investment for beginner and casual investors, while the technology sector is better for a growth-oriented investor who plans on actively monitoring their investment.

- **Project 2**: 
SQL Analytics for Northwind Traders
  - **Description**: Northwind Traders is a wholesale provider of consumer staples. We're going to analyze sales data from Northwind Traders to find meaninful insights for upper management.
  - **Technologies Used**: Python, SQL
  - **Key Findings**: Steve Buchanan was the highest performing salesperson in 1996. Beverages came in 1st place as the highest performing category, followed by Dairy Products in 2nd place.

## Installation

### Installing Anaconda
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Here's how you can install Anaconda on your system:

1. Download the Anaconda installer:
   - Visit the [Anaconda downloads page](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows.html) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. Install Anaconda:
   - Go to your Downloads folder and double-click the installer to launch.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
   - It is recommended to install Anaconda for "Just Me" unless you require an all-users installation which needs admin privileges.

3. After installation, you can find Anaconda Navigator on your system which is an easy-to-use GUI that allows you to manage your environments and packages.

### Using Anaconda to Open Jupyter Notebooks
Once Anaconda is installed, you can use it to open Jupyter notebooks:

1. Launch Anaconda Navigator:
   - You can find Anaconda Navigator in your Start Menu or applications folder.

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   - In Anaconda Navigator, find the Jupyter Notebook app and click 'Launch'.
   - This will open Jupyter in your default web browser.

3. Navigate to your project:
   - Use the Jupyter interface to navigate to the directory where your `.ipynb` files are located.

4. Open a notebook:
   - Click on an `.ipynb` file to open it in a new tab within Jupyter.

5. Run the notebook:
   - Once the notebook is open, you can run the cells by clicking 'Run' or pressing `Shift + Enter`.

Remember to replace any placeholder text with your actual data or paths. These instructions will guide users through the process of setting up their environment to run the data science projects in your repository.
